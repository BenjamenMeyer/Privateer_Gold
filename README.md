# Privateer Gold
Privateer Gemini Gold - Updated for Modern releases of the Vegastrike engine.
It is not intended to build/release engine binaries at this time, this repository exists so that the community can benefit from access to the Privateer Gemini Gold content updated to run on modern systems.

# Status
Initial data has been imported - Game loads and runs. Main Menu is broken run the game with ./bin/vegastrike -d. explore_universe.mission
Work is focusing on porting the game scripts from Python 2.7 to Python 3. Some scripts are being replaced with Python 3 variants from the Vegastrike assets repository. The game can load/run but should be considered under heavy development at this point.
