# Privateer Gold
Privateer Gemini Gold - Updated for Modern releases of the Vegastrike engine.
It is not intended to build/release engine binaries at this time, this repository exists so that the community can benefit from access to the Privateer Gemini Gold content updated to run on modern systems.

# Status
Initial data has been imported - Game loads and runs. Run the game with ./bin/vegastrike -d.
Work is focusing on porting the game scripts from Python 2.7 to Python 3. Some scripts are being replaced with Python 3 variants from the Vegastrike assets repository. The game can load and run but should be considered unstable at this point.

# Installation
Checkout the git repository with git clone https://github.com/DMJC/Privateer_Gold 
Checkout the code from:  https://github.com/vegastrike/Vega-Strike-Engine-Source build it and then place the binaries into Privateer_Gold/bin
run the game from the Privateer_Gold folder with ./bin/vegastrike -d.
